# Alfred AppleScript Key Code Workflow
An Alfred workflow that acts as a quick reference/lookup tool when you need to enter a key code during scripting.

## About Workflow
As someone pretty new to the world of scripting, automations and Alfred, I found myself constantly referring to the AppleScript key code list for certain GUI automations (I'm sure many of these are easily done via other language, but I'm learning to walk first!) 
After a while of doing this, I decided to look for a key code workflow but really couldn't find one that had all the keys mapped. While I was building it, I also thought I'd shave off a couple of seconds of typing by outputting the text including any appropriate modifier keys (such as key code 12 using {command down, shift down}), created icons for each key, and now thought someone else could benefit from this fun little build.
 
## Usage
Hotkey + Space followed by any letter on the keyboard. If you need modifiers, press any combination and hit enter. The workflow will paste the result in the application with focus and include any modifiers such as {command down, option down}.
